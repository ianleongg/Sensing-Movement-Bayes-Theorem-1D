# **Sensing and Movement**

## Bayes Theorem to Sense and Move a Robot in 1D

### Using C++ to implement the algorithm

---

**Sensing and Movement Robot in 1D Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Declare and define all vectors and probability vectors.
* Fill in our world and measurement vectors (eg: green or red position).
* Ititerate through our measurements with sense and movement functions.
* The sense and movement functions and derived using Bayes Theorem.
* Get the probablity of the robot located in a position.

The main code is located in [here](./one_d_sensing_and_movement.cpp).
